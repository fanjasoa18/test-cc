# Rice Cooker Simulator
This README serves as a guide for understanding the key complexities and improvements made to the Rice Cooker Simulator.

## Details:

### Original Code
#### Cognitive Complexity: 
    High cognitive complexity in simulateRiceCooker:
  "Function simulateRiceCooker has a Cognitive Complexity of __18__ (exceeds 5 allowed)"

#### Temporal Complexity: 
    Infinite loop in 'simulateRiceCooker'.

#### Spatial Complexity: 
    Generally constant space complexity.


### Refactored Code
#### Cognitive Complexity: 
    Significantly reduced, resulting in a more maintainable codebase:
  "Function simulateRiceCooker has a Cognitive Complexity of __7__ (exceeds 5 allowed)"

#### Time Complexity: 
    Improved with better readability, asynchronous operations, and a structured menu system.

#### Space Complexity: 
    Maintained low space complexity (O(1)).

Tool Used
[CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com/github/fanjasoa18/test-cc/issues?category=complexity&engine_name%5B%5D=structure&engine_name%5B%5D=duplication) was used to assess and improve the code's cognitive complexity.


## Conclusion
The refactoring process focused on enhancing readability, maintainability, and potential performance.
